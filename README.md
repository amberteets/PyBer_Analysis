# PyBer Ridesharing Analysis

## Overview

This analysis was undertaken to help the ride-sharing company PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods by creating visualizations of ride-share data.

## Results

The greatest number of PyBer rides occur in Urban cities, followed by Suburban and then Rural cities. Similarly, Urban cities have the greatest number of drivers and are responsible for the most fare revenue for PyBer. However, the per-ride fare is lower on average in Urban cities than Suburban or Rural cities, as is the average fare per PyBer driver employed.
