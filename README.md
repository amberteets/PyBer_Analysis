# PyBer Ridesharing Analysis

## Overview

This analysis was undertaken to help the ride-sharing company PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods by creating visualizations of ride-share data.

## Results

The greatest number of PyBer rides occur in Urban cities, followed by Suburban and then Rural cities. Similarly, Urban cities have the greatest number of drivers and are responsible for the most fare revenue for PyBer. However, the per-ride fare is lower on average in Urban cities than Suburban or Rural cities, as is the average fare per PyBer driver employed.

## Recommendations

To address the disparities between city types, more information is needed to determine if the differences are simply due to supply and demand, or if PyBer's policies are to blame. For instance, rural cities may have fewer drivers and higher fares per ride because the population is smaller and the average ride distance is longer than in urban settings. PyBer may want to investigate whether a different fee structure for different city types is appropriate. PyBer could also introduce incentive programs to attract more drivers in suburban and rural communities.
